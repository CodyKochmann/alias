# alias
This contains all of my main aliases for linux administration to make the command line more friendly and easy to use. Take whatever you want, this is primarily up here so I can run the following command in order to make any new machine easier to use. These snippets were designed while using debian and Ubuntu so please use with caution while using with other systems.

#####Command to install these aliases

```bash
wget -qO- https://<raw-alias-link> | python
```
